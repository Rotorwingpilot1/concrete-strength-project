# concrete-strength-project
Concrete Strength Project from my AL/ML Certificate 

Summary:
Using the data collected from existing customers, build a model that will help the marketing team identify potential customers who are relatively more likely to subscribe term deposit and thus increase their hit ratio.

 

Attribute Information:
Given are the variable name, variable type, the measurement unit, and a brief description. The concrete compressive strength is the regression problem. The order of this listing corresponds to the order of numerals along the rows of the database.

Cement - kg in a m3 mixture (input variable)
Blast Furnace Slag - kg in a m3 mixture (input variable)
Fly Ash - kg in a m3 mixture (input variable)
Water - kg in a m3 mixture (input variable)
Superplasticizer - kg in a m3 mixture (input variable)
Coarse Aggregate - kg in a m3 mixture (input variable)
Fine Aggregate - kg in a m3 mixture (input variable)
Age - day (1 - 365) (input variable)
Concrete compressive strength - MPa (output variable)
 

Objective:
To predict the concrete strength using the data available in file "concrete.csv". Apply feature engineering and model tuning to obtain 85% to 95% accuracy.
